# Capital Flow Explorer

See how your money moves. Capital Flow Explorer shows where your portfolio's money flows across different risk levels over time. Connect the dots between market news, interest rates, and your investments in one clear view.

## 1. Insight Discovery

**See patterns others miss.** Watch how your portfolio shifts between safe and risky investments as markets change. Assets are grouped into five risk bands (from safe to very risky), revealing how money moves across risk levels over time.

**Connect events to outcomes.** News signals appear on the timeline, showing when market events happened. See how Fed rate changes, news sentiment, and market conditions line up with portfolio movements.

**Understand the why.** Drill into any risk band to see which assets drove performance, when you bought or sold them, and how they contributed to overall returns.

## 2. Technical Execution

Built with modern tools for speed and reliability. React and TypeScript ensure the app runs smoothly even with large datasets. Custom data processing scripts handle portfolio data, news analysis, and API connections. The code is organized for easy maintenance and future updates.

## 3. Visualization & Communication

**The River Chart** - Watch money flow across risk bands like a river over time. Interactive controls let you play through history, filter by asset type, and select different metrics.

**News Overlay** - Financial news appears as colored dots on the timeline. Green for good news, red for bad, gray for neutral. Click any dot to read the full story.

**Fed Rates** - Toggle interest rates on the chart to spot connections between policy changes and your investments.

**Inspector Panel** - Click any risk band to see individual assets, their performance, and transaction history.

## 4. Data Integration

Pulls data from multiple sources and brings it together. Portfolio data comes from Qplix API. Financial news is fetched and analyzed for sentiment. Fed rate data is integrated to show policy context. Everything flows into one unified view.
